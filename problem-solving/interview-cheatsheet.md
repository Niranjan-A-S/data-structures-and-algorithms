# Interview Cheat Sheet

## The 3 Pillars of Good Code:
1. Readable
2. Time Complexity
3. Space Complexity

## Skills Interviewer is Looking For:
- Analytic Skills: How well can you think through problems and analyze them?
- Coding Skills: Can you write clean, simple, organized, and readable code?
- Technical Knowledge: Do you know the fundamentals of the job you're applying for?
- Communication Skills: Does your personality match the company's culture?

## Step By Step Through a Problem:
1. Write down key points when the interviewer presents the question.
2. Double-check inputs and outputs.
3. Identify the most important values and the main goal.
4. Avoid asking too many questions initially.
5. Start with the naive/brute force approach to show critical thinking.
6. Explain why the initial approach may not be the best.
7. Walk through the approach, identifying bottlenecks (focus on the biggest Big O).
8. Before coding, outline the steps you'll follow.
9. Modularize code from the beginning, breaking it into small, clear pieces.
10. Start coding with confidence and clarity.
11. Consider error checks and safeguarding against unexpected inputs.
12. Use meaningful variable names; write code that reads well.
13. Test thoroughly, considering various scenarios.
14. Discuss potential improvements with the interviewer.
15. Be prepared for extension questions.

## Good Code Checklist:
- [✅] It works
- [✅] Good use of data structures
- [✅] Code Re-use/Do Not Repeat Yourself
- [✅] Modular - makes code more readable, maintainable, and testable
- [✅] Less than O(N^2) - Avoid nested loops; two separate loops are better
- [✅] Low Space Complexity - Consider potential stack overflow or memory issues

## Heuristics to Ace the Question:
- [✅] Hash Maps can improve Time Complexity.
- [✅] Use Binary tree for sorted arrays to achieve O(log N).
- [✅] Consider sorting input.
- [✅] Utilize hash tables and precomputed information for optimization.
- [✅] Evaluate Time vs Space tradeoffs.
- [✅] Follow advice/tips/hints given by the interviewer.

## Always Remember:
- Communicate your thought process.
- Don't worry about finishing fast; every part of the interview matters.
